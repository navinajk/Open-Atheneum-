# Problem it solves
Not just paper and binding make up a book. It consists of the phrases and concepts written inside the covers. This lack of a physical object is the primary distinction between e-books and printed books. NFTs, which are currently the most hyped and sought-after due to their capacity to digitally represent the ownership proof of any good and be exchanged for real money, can be used by authors to create content that is impervious to censorship and by readers to enjoy reading like never before.

E-books have a smaller environmental impact. The connection to unpleasant paper mills and pointless tree slaughter is gone. No costly ink or glue is used. E-books have little to no carbon footprint compared to paper books. The use of e-books can increase with the use of NFTs for digital record keeping.
